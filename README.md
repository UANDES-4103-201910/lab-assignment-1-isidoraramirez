3. The code structure is divided in 2 main sections. The first one being the <head> tag. It's in this part of the code were the developer puts the data about the page. In this case, we can see with a few examples, that the width of the page will be in scale with the with of the device, that the style of the sheet is text/css and that the title of choice of the coder, that it's between the <title> tag, is "Hacker News".
After all the data has been set, the developer has to code what it's going to be in the page. This is going to be done in the <body> tag. In this case, all the content is grouped by a table. This talle contains the differrent hypertexts of the different post of the users. Each of this hypertexts has the score, user number of comments and how long ago it was published.
At the top of all the code is were the developer sets in what laguage the code will be written.

4. 
- The hn.js file, just like the name of the file says, it's in javascript. Here is were it's codeded the "back-stage" of the page, where all the prossesing of the page happens. For example, the voting function, that keeps the track of how many "Likes" the link has and it decrease it if someone who voted undo their vote.
- The news.css sets all the visual design of the page, including style, size and color of the different fonts along the page. It also sets what text should be a link and the sizes of the images or gifs that are included in the page. 
- the news or (index) file is in html language, were all the data of the page is set, and how it will be grouped. in this case, we can see that is grouped by tables (<table>), and how each section of the page is positioned.
- all the .gif are the moving images that the page has and uses.

5. In this we can see that there is a pause on the activity of the xhr, thas beacause in the fist 1000 ms aprox, the is sending the request to the server, and then it waits 500 ms for the response of the server. So the page loads in about 1500 ms.

6. It's valid from 21-08-2014 to 21-08-2019, released by COMODO RSA domain Validation Secure Server CA.
